# A-IoT Cube-SmartFarm Soil Montoring Using IoT

The quick objective of the project goes as follows:

- The real-time data collection of various soil characteristics using sensors with the help of Arduino and processing this data to bring out useful insights.

- All the sensors are enabled and planted at their respective positions embedded in the IoT cube safely.

- Then they are connected with the Arduino board while the power supply will be from the solar panel attached above the top of the cube.

- Using Artificial Intelligence to portray and predict the trend of their farm characteristics in a simple and understanding way for the farmer.

- The manipulations on the data can be easily done using any AI software like Machine Learning etc.

- Alerting the farmer about the current condition of the soil through SMS alert / Mobile application with a user-friendly GUI.
- Help farmers to take decisions on what to grow next and what and when to add and how much to add.

- This has a greater impact on their daily as well as future decisions regarding the farm.
